# Fake News Detection using Logistic Regression

This project aims to detect fake news using logistic regression, a machine learning algorithm commonly used for binary classification tasks. The project utilizes a dataset containing labeled news articles as either real or fake, and trains a logistic regression model to classify new articles based on their features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the logistic regression model consists of a collection of news articles labeled as either real or fake. It is important to note that the dataset should be properly preprocessed and balanced to ensure the model's effectiveness.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to remove noise, irrelevant information, and to standardize text data for analysis.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted from the preprocessed text data using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.

3. **Model Training**: A logistic regression model is trained using the extracted features and corresponding labels (real or fake) from the dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance in detecting fake news.

5. **Deployment**: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed in production environments for real-time fake news detection.

## Usage

To use the fake news detection system:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Train the logistic regression model by running:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify new news articles by running:
   ```
   python classify_news.py <news_text>
   ```
   Replace `<news_text>` with the text of the news article you want to classify.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
